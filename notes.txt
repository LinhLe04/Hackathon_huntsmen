Some quirks in my CSS template
- Bottom-border effect on mission link (topnav) might disappear --> have to manually set up

.topnav a[href*="mission.html"]:hover {
    /*Overriding non-hovering effects for sub-task 2A link*/
    color: white;
    border-bottom: 6px solid;
    border-bottom-color: #024213;
 }

Hero images on homepage and mission page were set differently
- Homepage: image link in CSS
- Mission: image link in HTML
	+ Black opacity not working - might consider deleing them altogether
- Border-bottom not behaving appropriately on page 1
